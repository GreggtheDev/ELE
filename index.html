                <h2>Ordovician-Silurian Extinction</h2>
                <p>The Ordovician-Silurian extinction events, occurring around 443 million years ago, are considered the second-largest extinction events in Earth's history. It is estimated that about 85% of marine species were wiped out during this period.</p>

                <p>This mass extinction is believed to have been caused by a combination of factors, including a severe ice age that led to drastic changes in sea levels and a decrease in oceanic oxygen levels. These environmental shifts greatly affected marine habitats, leading to the extinction of many species.</p>

            <div class="section" id="devonian">
                <h2>Late Devonian Extinction</h2>
                <p>The Late Devonian extinction, occurring around 372-359 million years ago, involved a prolonged series of extinction pulses that affected marine life significantly. About 75% of species were lost during this period.</p>

                <p>Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this extinction event, including changes in sea levels, anoxia in the oceans, and the impact of large land plants altering the soil and atmosphere. These changes likely disrupted marine ecosystems, leading to the loss of many species.</p>

            <div class="section" id="permian">
                <h2>Permian-Triassic Extinction</h2>
                <p>The Permian-Triassic extinction event, also known as the Great Dying, occurred around 252 million years ago. It is the largest extinction event in Earth's history, with an estimated 96% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species going extinct.</p>
                <img src="https://cdn.sci.news/images/enlarge7/image_8965e-End-Permian-Mass-Extinction.jpg" alt="Permian-Triassic Extinction">
                <p>This mass extinction is believed to have been caused by massive volcanic eruptions in the Siberian Traps, leading to severe climate change, ocean acidification, and anoxia. The environmental consequences were catastrophic, affecting almost all life on Earth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section" id="triassic">
                <h2>Triassic-Jurassic Extinction</h2>
                <p>The Triassic-Jurassic extinction event, occurring around 201 million years ago, resulted in the loss of about 76% of all species. This event paved the way for the rise of dinosaurs as the dominant terrestrial vertebrates.</p>

                <p>Several factors are thought to have contributed to this extinction, including massive volcanic eruptions from the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), climate change, and potentially an asteroid impact. These events led to significant environmental changes, causing widespread species loss.</p>

            <div class="section" id="cretaceous">
                <h2>Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction</h2>
                <p>The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event, occurring around 66 million years ago, is perhaps the most well-known extinction event, as it led to the demise of the dinosaurs. Approximately 75% of Earth's species were lost during this event.</p>
                <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FAdM9sLkkfPpEQu4m4dm8a.jpg" alt="Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction">
                <p>The leading theory for this extinction is the impact of a massive asteroid or comet in the Yucatan Peninsula, forming the Chicxulub crater. This impact would have caused immediate and severe environmental changes, including wildfires, tsunamis, and a "nuclear winter" effect that drastically altered the climate.</p>
